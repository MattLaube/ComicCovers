# ComicCovers
A test app to demo connecting to the Marvel APIs found here:
https://developer.marvel.com/

The app allows the user to choose an issue of "The Immortal Hulk" from a spinner (drop down) and see the cover and some basic meta data.  
# To Run
You will need a set of API keys from https://developer.marvel.com/.  Add these keys to a file in the root of the project called "apikey.properties" with the following format:


PUBLIC_KEY = "Your public key here" 

PRIVATE_KEY = "Your private key here"

apikey.properties must be placed in the root of the project.
